Traceroute - Java Applet
------------------------
------------------------

* Traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool originally written by Van Jacobson to determine whether routing problems exist on the network. It can be used to determine the path IP packets are taking from your computer to the destination computer.

    - Windows uses an ICMP only traceroute utility called **tracert**.
    - Unix based systems use a UDP based **traceroute**.

* In this applet I have implemented both versions. 

* This applet will be uploaded to http://wps.pearsoned.com/ecs_kurose_compnetw_6/216/55463/14198700.cw/index.html website.
