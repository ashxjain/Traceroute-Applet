Traceroute - Java Applet
------------------------
------------------------

* Traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool originally written by Van Jacobson to determine whether routing problems exist on the network. It can be used to determine the path IP packets are taking from your computer to the destination computer.

    - Windows uses an ICMP only traceroute utility called **tracert**.
    - Unix based systems use a UDP based **traceroute**.

* In this applet I have implemented both versions. 

Requirements
------------
* You need a *java compatible* browser

How to run
----------
* First compile the file Traceroute.java using the following command (You can also use any IDE as well to compile the code):

    
    $javac Traceroute.java

* Then open **index.html** page in your browser
